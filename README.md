How to test locally:
1. Open index.html in a browser for front-end only view.
2. For payments, implement a server endpoint POST /api/airtel/collect that calls Airtel Money or a local gateway.
   Store API credentials server-side and follow Airtel developer docs: https://developers.airtel.africa/
3. If you want, I can also generate server-side example code (Node/Express or PHP) and a webhook handler.
